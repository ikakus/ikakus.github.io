# Quefrency: split, staggered, DIY mechanical keyboard 

Initlally I was palnning to build a Iris keyboard, but they got discontinued, at least rev.2 that has pro micro that you have to solder which was one of my whishes. So after a bit of research I've decided to build a Quefrency as it is pretty similar to fascinating Ultimate Hacking Keyboard, it is programmable, it is split and has not very different layout compared to Iris, Planck or Dactyl.

# Assembly

Quefrency is a good enty level DIY mechanical keyboard for the number of reasons:
- Almost standard TKL layout.
- Great [documentation and build guide](https://docs.keeb.io/quefrency-rev1-build-guide/).
- Comparably cheap and easy to find parts.

I won't be covering entire build process, build guide does a great job explaingin it, I will show changes that I've made that are not included in the guide.

I've ordered all of the parts from [keeb.io](https://keeb.io/), great shop with fast delivery. Aluminium case  plates are ok, but their cut-out tolerances make switches wabble.

I've found solution using my carbon fibey vinil wrap, it does look "street racer" by I like matte look and feel of it.

I've apllied one piece on both halves to match pattern, and cut out holes later with a hobby knife.

Now wabble is gone it also works as a sort of dumper for switches.
# Improvements

Once I've started to use it as my daily driver I realised that keyboard was too high for my taste, and wrist pads are a must. I have not found any solution on the internet so I had to go with my own. I wanted simple and removable solution, and I fount corkwood cutting paltes and few neodymium magnets to solve it almost perfectly!
